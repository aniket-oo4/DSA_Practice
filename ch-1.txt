Recursion ??--
    When  afunction calls itself until the specified condition is  met 
    --> If there is no spefied condition is mention there there is  a Infinite Recursion
    --> When there is Infinite Recursion then it Causes the condition known as Stack OverFlow 
      explaination 
        -->  Method is stored in A stack memory 
            --> and removed when method Return statement xecutes 
            --> in Infinite Recursion methods keeps calling anohter method and there is no [Complete execution of any method ] return 
            --Then the called methods keeps added on top of the current  stack and they are stays on wait  ,
            -->the methods keeps on calling another methods then there is segmentation Fault happens And This is called as Stack OverFlow    

    
    --> Always Keep in mind while using recursion  , writing the Recursive Method
        --> Always Write  Base [Termination ]Condition of method before the Recursive call of method ;
            --> There may be single base condition or multiple base conditions also 


    Recursion Tree : Its A diagram of how the calls Made 
                     : F() --->F() --> F() ---> F()  calling
